## Overview
The handwritten digit recognition is the ability of computers to recognize human handwritten digits. It is a hard task for the machine because handwritten digits are not perfect and can be made with many different flavors. The handwritten digit recognition is the solution to this problem which uses the image of a digit and recognizes the digit present in the image.

## Installation
The code is written in Python 3.7 in Jupyter Notebook. If you dont have it you can first download Anaconda platform [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/), where You will find the Jupyter Notebook within it. Jupyter Notebooks are powerful, versatile, shareable and provide the ability to perform data visualization in the same environment.It also allows data scientists to create and share their documents, from codes to full blown reports. They help data scientists streamline their work and enable more productivity and easy collaboration. Due to these and several other reasons you will see below, Jupyter Notebooks are one of the most popular tools among data scientists.

After installing Anaconda, you have to install two packages-
1. "Scikit Learn" library for preprocessing the data. You can install Scikit Learn [here.](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)
2. "keras" library to build the model. For that you have to run the following code in anaconda prompt.
`pip install keras`

After completing the installation process, run the Jupyter Notebook where you can use the code (`CNN Handwritten.ipynb`).
